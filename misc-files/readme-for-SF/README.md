##Deviser



*Deviser* stands for *"Design Explorer and
Viewer for Iterative SBML Enhancement of Representations"*. 

The Deviser Edit tool allows you to quickly define an [SBML L3 package](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications#SBML_Level_3_Packages). 
It then provides the  following functionality

1.	Create and view a UML diagram.
2.	Generate the necessary libSBML code for the package.
3.	Generate TeX files and generate a pdf of a basic specification 
document for the package.
4.	Integrate and test the package with [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML). 


The source code and distributions are available from the deviser project repository on GitHub:
